        </h2>
        <p>
          The governance of the Internet computer is controlled by the Network
          Nervous System. A neuron confers voting rights and other benefits.
        </p>
      </header>
      <p>
        To prevent abuse or deliberate harm to the platform and community,
        blockchain platforms usually rely on governance. Voting rights are often
        attached to conditions that make it unattractive to misbehave while
        providing stability. Dfinity's Internet Computer has developed a similar
        concept.<br />
        Changes to the configuration and other adjustments must be decided
        collectively. The brain of the Internet Computer is the Network Nervous
        System (NNS). It is responsible for various aspects of the platform,
        including:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Which data centers are allowed to participate in the network</li>
        <li>How many nodes form a subnet and how they are organized</li>
        <li>Deciding on upgrades to Smart Contracts like canister software</li>
        <li>
          Status updates of the Internet Computer Blockchain and its copies
        </li>
        <li>Changes to the Internet Computer Protocol</li>
        <li>Freezing malicious canisters to protect the platform</li>
      </ul>

          <h3>STAKING</h3>
          <p>
            Neurons are created by a user locking balances of the native ICP
            token hosted in a ledger within the NNS. That process is also known
            as "Stacking". Stacked balances on the Internet Computer can only be
            released when the neuron is resolved.<br />
            For the stability and security of the Internet Computer, it is
            important, that as many users as possible actively participate in
            the governance process. Incentives for participation are created by
            offering users the prospect of rewards for their activity in voting.

      <h3>The Network Nervous System</h3>
      <p>
        Proposals can be voted on via the Network Nervous System. For example,
        whether to expand the network by adding subnets or onboarding new nodes.
        Another important function of the Network Nervous System is to combine
        nodes from independent data centers with the goal of creating subnets
        that are used to host canisters. Those are a further development of
        smart contracts. The subnets are created based on the capacity
        requirements of the hosting canister and its ability to connect to other
        subnets. This enables the Internet Computer to have an infinite
        scalability. You can find more details about these functions and tasks
        in the following video...
