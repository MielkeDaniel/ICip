        <h3>About Us</h3>
        <p>
          The DFINITY Foundation is dedicated to bringing people and
          organizations together to learn about and collaborate on the
          next-generation of decentralized applications. The Internet Computer
          allows developers to build dapps that are scaleable, run smart
          contracts at web speed, and serve user experiences directly on chain.
          We believe in a future in which every system and service is rebuilt
          and reimagined using smart contracts and runs entirely from public
          blockchains without need for traditional IT. Weâ€™re committed to
          connecting those who believe the same through our events, content, and
          discussions.

      <h2>The Mission</h2>
      <div>
        <div>
          <p>
            DFINITY believes, that "smart contracts", that run on a public
            blockchain are a vastly superior new form of software. However,
            traditional blockchains provide hosting frameworks for smart
            contracts that are highly limiting. We believe that once these
            limitations are removed by a next generation blockchain, a
            "blockchain singularity" will occur, in which the majority of the
            world's systems and services will be rebuilt entirely from smart
            contracts. In the process, these systems and services will be
            fundamentally reimagined, changing how our information systems,
            financial systems, economy and society works, by leveraging the many
            new capabilities that smart contracts provide.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            Our mission is to develop technology that supports the next
            generation Internet Computer blockchain network and ecosystem. Among
            many firsts, the Internet Computer is the first public blockchain
            that can scale the capacity it provides to smart contracts without
            bound, allowing it to process and maintain any amount of data
            required. It can run smart contracts with efficiency approaching
            that of traditional software, while keeping costs low and
            predictable. It hosts smart contracts that run at web speed, and
            which can serve interactive web content directly to end users
            without intermediaries, providing for the creation of systems and
            services that run entirely from a blockchain. The blockchain also
            runs under the control of an algorithmic governance system and is
            self-directed.
