          <h3>How does it work?</h3>
          <p>
            The Internet Computer blockchain is hosted across a series of data
            centers that contain multiple nodes. These nodes from the different
            data centers are aggregated together, which is called a subnet. Each
            subnet can host its own proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain using a
            unique consensus model called a threshold relay. The subnets in ICP
            are similar in function to Polkadot's parachain model. They allow
            developers to build their applications on the subnets.

      />
      <div>
        <h3>How do transactions work?</h3>
        <p>
          Because a subnet consists of only a few nodes running from different
          data centers, the Inernet computer blockchain can process transactions
          within seconds. This allows a processing time comparable to the
          traditional centralized Internet. In addition, interaction with
          Canister-based dApps on the Internet computer is free of charge.
          However, transactions over decentralized financial protocols (DeFi)
          require a small transaction fee to process requests for credit
          platforms or decentralized exchanges (DEXs).

        <h3>What makes it different?</h3>
        <p>
          Unlike current crypto projects and platforms, the Internet Computer
          does not use smart contracts. Instead, the applications are created in
          so-called canisters. Canisters are similar to smart contracts, but
          offer greater flexibility as well as development possibilities and are
          more user-friendly. Canisters can also automatically update themselves
          on other subnets and be used by other developers to create various
          decentralized application (dApps).

          <span>Cycles</span>
        </h2>
        <p>
          To execute a task on a blockchain, computing resources are required.
          With the Internet Computer, these computational costs for computing
          resources are expressed in cycles.
        </p>
      </header>
      <div>
        <div>
          <h3>What are Cycles?</h3>
          <p>
            Basically, the canisters, a further development of smart contracts,
            consume very different resources. CPU units are needed to execute a
            canister, routing messages requires bandwidth, and storing
            persistent data consumes memory. Canisters have an account balance
            to pay for all of the above costs of communication, computation, and
            memory consumed.
          </p>
          <p>
            The actual operating costs, which include physical hardware, energy
            costs, storage devices, and bandwidth, among other things, are
            expressed in Cycles units for the Internet Computer. One of these
            units thus corresponds to the cost of running a single WebAssembly
            application. Since the Internet Computer operates on an
            all-or-nothing basis, the distributed applications (DApps) must have
            a sufficiently funded account balance for full execution.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3>How do Cycles work?</h3>
          <p>
            The Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) token is the native currency of
            Internet computing. Users can hold an ICP token inside a neuron to
            participate in Network Nervous System (NNS) governance, or convert
            it into Cycles to run software on the network.Each Canister on the
            Internet computer must have an account with Cycles to cover the
            costs of communication, c omputation and storage.
          </p>
          <p>
            Developers can convert ICP tokens into Cycles and transfer them to
            the respective Canister account. However, the Internet Computer
            Platform places limits on how many Cycle units a Canister can hold
            and consume. This limit is intended to prevent malicious or buggy
            programs from consuming resources unnecessarily.
